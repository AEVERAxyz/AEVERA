# AEVERA

> **"In a world of vanishing moments, AEVERA is your anchor in time."**

AEVERA is a decentralized protocol designed to send encrypted messages into the future. It utilizes **Time-Lock Encryption (Identity-Based Encryption)** via the **Drand Network** to ensure that data remains mathematically inaccessible until a specific future timestamp ("The Era of Reveal").

### 🌌 The Vision
Unlike traditional "dead man switches" or scheduled emails, AEVERA relies on **0% Trust**. There is no backend database holding your secrets. The entire logic lives on the Base Blockchain.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Blockchain:** Base (Layer 2)
* **Encryption:** AES-256 + Drand Time-Lock (tlock-js)
* **Framework:** Next.js / Vite
* **Identity:** ENS & Basenames (via Alchemy)
